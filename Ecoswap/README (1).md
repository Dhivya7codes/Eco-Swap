## Description
India faces a significant challenge with unorganized waste management. Millions of ragpickers, NGOs, and local recyclers work in silos without visibility, fair compensation, or a proper channel to contribute effectively. The lack of digital infrastructure leads to inefficiencies, exploitation, and missed opportunities for both environmental and economic sustainability.

EcoSwap bridges this gap by offering a unified digital platform that connects waste contributors and recyclers in real time. It empowers ragpickers, NGOs, and buyers with transparency, traceability, and fair trade through geo-tagged listings, role-based dashboards, and an integrated communication systemâ€”turning waste into a valuable, traceable resource.

This project is a NextJS application built within Firebase Studio. It serves as a starter template for building web applications with NextJS and integrating with Firebase services.
