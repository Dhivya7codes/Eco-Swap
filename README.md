# Eco-Swap
India’s waste ecosystem is fragmented, leaving ragpickers, NGOs, and recyclers without fair pay or visibility. EcoSwap solves this by digitally connecting them through geo-tagged listings, role-based dashboards, and real-time communication—ensuring transparency, traceability, and fair trade.
